To use this project, you will be able to open up the live URL in Chrome through the DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I on mac OS. A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser.

# Credits

I credit Chad and Nick and the rest of the UCI Bootcamp for teaching me the tools to complete this task and then a UCI tutor to help me out with some functions and refactoring.
